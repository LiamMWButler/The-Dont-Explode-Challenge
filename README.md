This Mod is a **Challenge mod** which requires players to start and end when they want. After a certain amount of time the mod will randomly pick out the number of players on the server/world to **EXPLODE!** Destroying everything around them.

There is no **'End Goal'** You as the player can set that part of the challenge for yourself! 

I would personally recommend **3+ Players** just to mix up the randomness a bit more, **But it can be played, Solo or with 2 Players!** 

```
